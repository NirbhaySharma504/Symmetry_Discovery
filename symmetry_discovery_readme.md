# Symmetry Discovery

A research-oriented implementation for discovering and learning symmetries from data using deep learning. This project was developed as part of a GSoC selection task focused on symmetry-aware machine learning and physics-inspired representation learning.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores how neural networks can **learn transformations (symmetries)** directly from data rather than relying on predefined rules.

Using MNIST as a controlled setting, the pipeline:

- Generates rotated datasets
- Learns latent representations using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Models transformations in latent space
- Discovers symmetries in both supervised and unsupervised settings

---

## 📌 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Dataset Preparation & Latent Space

- Created a rotated MNIST dataset (0°–330° in 30° steps)
- Optional filtering for digits (e.g., 0–1 for efficiency)
- Built and trained a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**
- Encoded images into a structured latent space

### ✅ Task 2: Supervised Symmetry Discovery

- Trained an **MLP on latent space**
- Learned mappings corresponding to rotation transformations
- Modeled symmetry as transformations between latent vectors

### ✅ Task 3: Unsupervised Symmetry Discovery

- Learned symmetry operators directly from latent representations
- Identified transformations that preserve class/logit structure
- Demonstrated emergence of rotation as a discovered symmetry

## 🧠 Key Components

### Models

- `VAE` – Learns compact latent representation
- `RotationMLP` – Learns explicit transformation mappings
- `LatentClassifier` – Evaluates latent separability
- `SymmetryGenerator` – Learns symmetry operators

### Pipeline

1. Load & rotate dataset
2. Train VAE
3. Encode dataset → latent space
4. Train transformation models
5. Evaluate symmetry discovery
